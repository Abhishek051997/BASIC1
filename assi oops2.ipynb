    "There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode\n",

    "\n",
    "ans-Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
    "Closing a file after use is important because it frees up system resources that are being used by the file. When a file is open, the operating system allocates memory and other resources to the file, which can potentially impact the performance of the system if too many files are open at the same time"

    "The with statement works with the open() function to open a file. Unlike open() where you have to close the file with the close() method, the with statement closes the file for you without you telling it to. This is because the with statement calls 2 built-in methods behind the scene â€“ __enter()__ and __exit()__\n",
    "n Python, you can access a file by using the open() method. However, using the open() method directly requires you to use the close() method to close the file explicitly. Instead, you can create a context using the with Open statement in python.\n"
