    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans- CLASS-\n",
    "We use the class keyword to create a class in Python. For example\n",
    "         class ClassName:\n",
    "           # class definition \n",
    "    \n",
    "   Let's see an example,\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bike:\n",
    "    name = \"\"\n",
    "    gear = 0\n",
    "Here,\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike - the name of the class\n",
    "name/gear - variables inside the class with default values \"\" and 0 respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "OBJECT-\n",
    "An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects like bike1, bike2, etc from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the syntax to create an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "objectName = ClassName()\n",
    "Let's see an example,\n",
    "\n",
    "# create class\n",
    "class Bike:\n",
    "    name = \"\"\n",
    "    gear = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# create objects of class\n",
    "bike1 = Bike()\n",
    "Here, bike1 is the object of the class. Now, we can use this object to access the class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2- Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "The Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Abstraction.\n",
    "Encapsulation.\n",
    "Inheritance.\n",
    "Polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes\n",
    " \n",
    "   The __init__() Function\n",
    "The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:\n",
    "\n",
    "ExampleGet your own Python Server\n",
    "Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p1.name)\n",
    "print(p1.age)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Parent Class\n",
    "Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:\n",
    "\n",
    "ExampleGet your own Python Server\n",
    "Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, fname, lname):\n",
    "    self.firstname = fname\n",
    "    self.lastname = lname\n",
    "\n",
    "  def printname(self):\n",
    "    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = Person(\"John\", \"Doe\")\n",
    "x.printname()\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Child Class\n",
    "To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
